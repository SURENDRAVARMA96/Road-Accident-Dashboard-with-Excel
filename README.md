Road Accident Data Analysis

This project analyzes road accident data obtained from Kaggle to gain insights on accident patterns and identify potential areas for improvement in road safety. The project involved the following steps:

- Data gathering: The project used the publicly available road accident data from Kaggle, which contained records of accidents in various locations across the country.

- Data cleaning: The raw data obtained from Kaggle was pre-processed and cleaned using Excel to ensure consistency and accuracy in the data. Duplicate records, incomplete records, and errors were removed or corrected as necessary.

- Data exploration: The cleaned data was analyzed and visualized using pivot tables and charts in Excel to identify patterns and trends in the accident data. The analysis revealed that the majority of accidents occur in urban areas during the night time and that many accidents are caused by drivers not following safety measures.

- Insights: Based on the data analysis, it was recommended that efforts be made to raise awareness among drivers about the importance of following safety measures, such as wearing seat belts and avoiding distracted driving. Additionally, it was recommended that street lights be improved in all areas to prevent accidents from occurring during the night.

Overall, the project provided valuable insights into road safety and highlighted potential areas for improvement to reduce the occurrence of accidents on the road.
